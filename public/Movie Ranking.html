<h3> The poetry </h3>
<p> </p>A letter to all my exes <br>
You act as a fatherless child,<br>
Far less better than your own pride <br>
In amongst life's streets, <br>
Crying dirt out of your concrete eyes <br>
But even if taking my heart was as easy <br>
As taking back all of the time,â€” I'd be stuck in the past,<br>
As two beings living out of a bag, suckling on our dreams </p>
